# Compound Components

> Compound components is a pattern where components are used together such that they share an implicit state that lets them communicate with each other in the background. A compound component is composed of a subset of child components that all work in tandem to produce some functionality. [React Component Patterns][1]

> Think of compound components like the <select> and <option> elements in HTML. Apart they donâ€™t do too much, but together they allow you to create the complete experience. [Kent C. Dodds][2]
