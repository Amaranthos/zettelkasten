# Pathfinding

> Pathfinding or pathing is the [[plotting]], by a computer [[application]], of the shortest route between two points. It is a more practical variant on solving mazes. This field of research is based heavily on [[dijkstras-algorithm]] for finding the shortest path on a weighted [[graph]].
