# URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

> A URL, colloquially termed a [[web-address]], is a reference to a [[web-resource]] that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of [[uri]], although many people use the two terms interchangeably. URLs occur most commonly to reference [[web-page]] ([[http]]) but are also used for file transfer ([[ftp]]), [[email]] (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications
