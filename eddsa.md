# EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm)

> In [[cryptography#Public-key (Asymetric)]], Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) is a [[digital-signature]] scheme using a variant of Schnorr signature based on twisted Edwards curves. It is designed to be faster than existing digital signature schemes without sacrificing security.
