# X.509

> In cryptography, X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard defining the format of public key certificates. X.509 certificates are used in many [[internet]] [[protocol]]s, including TLS/SSL, which is the basis for [[HTTPS]], the secure protocol for browsing the [[world-wide-web]]. They are also used in offline applications, like electronic signatures.
