# Git

> Git is a [[distributed]] [[version-control]] system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on [[source code]] during [[software development]]. Its goals include speed, [[data integrity]], and support for [[distributed]], [[non-linear]] workflows [wikipedia][1]
