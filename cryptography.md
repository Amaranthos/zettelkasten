# Cryptography

> Cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing [[protocols]] that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects of [[information security]] such as [[data confidentiality]], [[data integrity]], [[authentication]], and [[non-repudiation]] are central to modern cryptography > &mdash; <cite>[wikipedia][1]</cite>

## Symmetric-key

Both the sender and the receiver share the same key.
[[cipher]]s are implemented as either [[cipher#Block ciphers|Block ciphers]] or [[cipher#Stream ciphers|Stream ciphers]]

Examples include:

- [[aes]]

## Public-key (Asymetric)

Two different, but mathematically related keys.
Public key may be widely shared, private key should be private
Public key is used for [[encryption]], private key for [[decryption]]
Now widely used to allow two parties to secretly agger on a shared [[encryption]] key

Also used for implementing [[digital-signature]] schemes

Examples include:

- [[rsa]]
- [[eddsa]]
