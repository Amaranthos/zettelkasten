# REST

> Representational state transfer (REST) is a [[software architectural]] style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the [[world-wide-web]]. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave. The REST architectural style emphasises the [[scalability]] of interactions between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, and the creation of a layered architecture to facilitate caching components to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce [[security]], and encapsulate legacy systems.
