# CORS

> Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a [[web-page]] to be requested from another [[domain]] outside the [[domain]] from which the first resource was served. [wikipedia][1]
> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional [[http-headers]] to tell browsers to give a [[web-application]] running at one [[origin]], access to selected resources from a different [[origin]]. A [[web-application]] executes a cross-origin [[http-request]] when it requests a resource that has a different [[origin]] ([[domain]], [[protocol]], or [[port]]) from its own. [MDN web docs][2]
