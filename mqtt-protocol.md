# MQTT Protocol

> MQTT is an open OASIS and [[ISO standard]] (ISO/IEC 20922) lightweight, publish-subscribe [[network protocol]] that transports messages between devices. The protocol usually runs over [[TCP]]/IP; however, any [[network protocol]] that provides ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections can support MQTT. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. [wikipedia][1]

> The MQTT protocol defines two types of network entities: a message broker and a number of clients. An [[MQTT broker]] is a server that receives all messages from the clients and then routes the messages to the appropriate destination clients. An MQTT client is any device (from a micro controller up to a full-fledged server) that runs an MQTT library and connects to an [[MQTT broker]] over a network. [wikipedia][1]
