# ECMAScript

> ECMAScript is a general-purpose [[programming]] language, standardized by Ecma International according to the document ECMA-262. It is a [[javascript]] standard meant to ensure the interoperability of Web pages across different [[web-browsers]]. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the [[world-wide-web]], and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using [[node-js]]. [wikipedia][1]
