# URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

> A URI is a unique sequence of characters that identifies a logical or physical resource used by web technologies. URIs may be used to identify anything, including real-world objects, such as people and places, concepts, or information resources such as web pages and books. Some URIs provide a means of locating and retrieving information resources on a network (either on the [[internet]] or on another private network, such as a computer filesystem or an Intranet); these are [[url]].
