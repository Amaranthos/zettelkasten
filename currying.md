# Currying

> In mathematics and computer science, [[currying]] is the technique of converting a [[function]] that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. [wikipedia][1]

## Uses

Composition of behaviours

## Examples

```js
const isType = (type) => (obj) => obj.type === type;

const isFruit = () => isType("Fruit");
const isVegetable = () => isType("Vegetable");

const fruits = items.filter(isFruit);
const vegetables = items.filter(isVegetable);
```
